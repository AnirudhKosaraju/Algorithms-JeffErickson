Describe recursive algorithms for the following generalizations of the SubsetSum problem:

(a) Given an array X[1...n] of positive integers and an integer T, compute the number of subsets of
    X whose elements sum to T

(b) Given two arrays X[1...n] and W[1...n] of positive integers and an integer T, where each W[i]
    denotes the weight of the corresponding element X[i], compute the maximum weight subset of X
    whose eleemnets sum to T. If no subset of X sums to T, your algorithm should return -inf
